As a preface, I am nowhere near fluent in German nor Hungarian, although I am a stickler for grammar.

## On beginning with German

German was always difficult to grasp at the beginning for me, an English speaker. This was largely in part due to its extensive case system, and gendered nouns.

It took me *months* to grasp the basic concepts such as accusative, dative, genetive. The flexible sentence structure with that combined? Get out, please.

I distinctively remember this one sentence they used in a textbook (Deutsch: Na klar!), about a postman and a dog.

In English:

> The dog bites the postman.

Following in German

> Den Postmann beißt der Hund.

Clearly the translations must be identical..  no wait.. The postman bites the dog? What in the world?

> Der Hund beißt den Postmann.

I failed to see how the accusative represents the result of an action! This basic concept.. I just could not for the life of me grasp it.
I remember distinctively reading over the sentence about 10-1000 times. It clicked eventually, about 3 weeks later.

Suddenly, the difficulties with the case system seemed entirely gone. What mattered now was positioning and further syntax rules to make sentences intelligible.

The key I learnt here, was to completely forget all notions of English word-order. Anecdotally I've often found that when people see a foreign language, their interpretation is that learning it would simply mean memorising the direct translation of a word, word-for-word. This would definitely help, but you fail to forget about things such as plural forms, declinations and verb conjugations.

I had this same feeling. I thought it would be akin to looking up a dictionary, finding the german for some words: enjoyed, it, and I, then being able to say "I enjoyed it!" just like a native. Couldn't be mooooore wrong. Could not be more wronger.
