# Hey, what's up?

Following a childhood passion of all things computing, I have a degree in Computer Science which helps me to pursue my programming endeavours.

My professional career consists of various soft and technical skills, such as team management, client relations, sales, customer service and conflict resolution.

In terms of an ever changing world of web development, I make sure to employ the latest technology trends to ensure that the end result is structured with professionalism and the future in mind.

In my free time I like to travel, go for a walk in Kings Park, explore the latest coffee trend in the CBD or practice a foreign language (I am struggling with German and Hungarian currently).
