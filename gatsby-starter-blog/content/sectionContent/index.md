# Warrantly

Warrantly is a full-stack Node.js based application designed to run in your browser. This a custom made application developed using Express.js with MongoDB on the backend, and HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS and some jQuery for the front-end.

Warrantly is designed to ease the returns authorisation process for a wholesaler, by allowing an all-in-one system for recording returns, items sent in advance and squaring off any replacement goods. It features automatic email dispatch, a rich global search and custom products.

## Motivation

Seeing a clear need for improvement, *Auto BlackBox Pty Ltd* now uses Warrantly for their entire returns operation.
